# Nikobus-HA

**fully implemented**
- Switches control.
- Lights control (dimmers).
- Cover/shutter support, (open/stop/close/set position).
- Buttons support. When a HA button is pressed, it will trigger the command on Nikobus. When a wall switch is pressed, it will trigger the refresh in HA.
    
You can create "virtual button" in HA and link them to an action in Nikobus. eg 000001

Automation example 

```
alias: "React to Nikobus Button Push"
description: "Perform actions when a Nikobus button is reported as pushed"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: nikobus_button_pressed
    event_data:
      address: "specific_button_address"  # Optional: Specify if you want to react to a specific button
action:
  - service: homeassistant.toggle
    entity_id: light.example_light
```
