# Nikobus-HA

**fully implemented**
- Switches control.
- Lights control (dimmers).
- Cover/shutter support, (open/stop/close/set position).
- Buttons support. When a HA button is pressed, it will trigger the command on Nikobus. When a wall switch is pressed, it will trigger the refresh in HA.
    
You can create "virtual button" in HA and link them to an action in Nikobus. eg 000001

Automation example 

```
alias: "React to Nikobus Button Push"
description: "Perform actions when a Nikobus button is reported as pushed"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: nikobus_button_pressed
    event_data:
      address: "specific_button_address"  # Optional: Specify if you want to react to a specific button
action:
  - service: homeassistant.toggle
    entity_id: light.example_light
```

If you want to add your shutters to HomeKit, I had to come up with the following.
As time allow, I will look at why it's not working directly from the integration.

```
 - platform: template
    covers:
      virtual_<yourshutter>:
        device_class: shutter
        friendly_name: "<yourshutter>"
        position_template: "{{ state_attr('cover.<yourshutter>', 'current_position') | int(100) }}"
        open_cover:
          service: cover.open_cover
          data: {}
          target:
            entity_id: cover.<yourshutter>
        close_cover:
          service: cover.close_cover
          data: {}
          target:
            entity_id: cover.<yourshutter>
        stop_cover:
          service: cover.stop_cover
          data: {}
          target:
            entity_id: cover.<yourshutter>
        set_cover_position:
          service: cover.set_cover_position
          data:
            position: "{{position}}"
            entity_id: cover.<yourshutter>
```

**BREAKING CHANGES**

The configuration files are no longer in the custom_integration directory but shall be placed in the HA/config. See install

Always restart from the nikobus_config.json as the template might have changed eg (added "operation_time" for shutters)


**Install**

You will need a RS232 to IP bridge for this integration to work (like HF2211 or others), as work complete with this proof of concept, I'm planning to extend to serial connectivity.

**Install Instruction**

One you have installed the custom integration using HACS, go to the custom_repository/nikobus
copy nikobus_conf.json.default to your HA config directory / nikobus_conf.json
copy nikobus_button_conf.json.default to your HA config directory / nikobus_button_conf.json

update the file to reflect your installation. Button are discovery when pushed and registered in the nikobus_button_conf.json

Integration supports
  switch_modules_addresses
  dimmer_modules_addresses 
  roller_modules_addresses

Update each section to reflect your nikobus installation, module address can be found on your nikobus software.

Now add "Nikobus" as an integration
